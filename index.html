		<h1>Welcome to Wayne County Genealogical Society of Richmond, Indiana</h1>
			<p>Wayne County Genealogical Society is a 501(c)4 non-profit organization focused on preserving the history of Wayne County, Indiana, and assisting those interested in learning about Wayne County history and ancestors. In February 2002, WCGS met the requirements and became a chapter of the <a href="https://www.indgensoc.org/"><em><strong> Indiana Genealogical Society. </strong></em></a></p>
